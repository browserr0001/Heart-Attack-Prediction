# heart-attack-classification

<p align="justify">
Program Explanation: This program is a program to predict whether a person is at low or high risk of having a heart attack. The idea is to import the required dataframe, perform data preprocessing, analyze data with EDA, then check multicollinearity, feature selection, feature scaling, data splitting, parameter hypertuning, modeling, predicting, and model evaluation.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Getting Started
1. You can access the raw data [here](https://github.com/hosiajosindra/heart-attack-classification/blob/main/heart.csv) within this repo.
2. All of the scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/hosiajosindra/heart-attack-classification/blob/main/heartattack.ipynb).

#### I hope this will be useful someday, thankyou for seeing !👌🏻
